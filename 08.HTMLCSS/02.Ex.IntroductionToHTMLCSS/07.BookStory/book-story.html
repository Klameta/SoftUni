            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <em>On The Road</em>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
